1. Have constructors preset all data (particularly strings and integers) to generic data that can be detected by the line storing code so that the library may check whether or not a file has been successfully loaded
2. Implement file validity check (as mentioned in point 1)
3. Implement parsing code
4. Run tests
5. If tests are failed, make bug fixes
